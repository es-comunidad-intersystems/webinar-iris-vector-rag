1926,US,"Some ageable Cabs are lovely to drink on release. Not this one. It's tough in tannins, with a gum-stinging astringency. Below all that are ripe, concentrated blackberry jam and cassis flavors.

1941,US,"Given the difficulties of the 2010 vintage, this wine is a success. The tannins are young, thick and astringent, and then the acids kick in. After that initial assault, the palate begins to get more interesting complexities of black currants, blueberries, minerals and oak. The suggestion is ageability, but only limited.

1978,Germany,"Scheurebe, a Riesling hybrid common in Germany and Austria, is a rare find stateside, particularly in dry styles. Zesty lime pith and pineapple flavors are brisk and revitalizing in this light-bodied sip. A touch of fresh herbs and white-tea astringency lend nuance to the crisp finish.",Qvinterra Trocken,88,23.0,Rheinhessen,,,Scheurebe,Kühling-Gillot
1979,France,"With vines in the northeast of the Gers region, this winery produces impressively ripe red wines. This wood-aged and spicy wine is still young and needs time to integrate the wood with the red berry fruits. It does have weight and potential richness, so give it until 2016.",La Croix d'Arton,88,12.0,Southwest France,Côtes de Gascogne,,Red Blend,Domaine d'Arton
1980,US,"Earthy aromas of dried herbs, forest floor and freshly felled fennel shrubs emerge form this blend from the now William Foley-owned Firestone brand. Warm cherries and tart acidity make for a nice blend of fruit and complexity on the palate.",,88,25.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Firestone
1981,France,"A soft and rounded wine, it's ripe, full in the mouth and warm in character. A steely edge merges with the ripe apple and pear flavors to give a wine that's rich and ready to drink.",Les Montachins,88,23.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Sauvignon Blanc,Gitton Père et Fils
1982,France,"Very dry, with a firm mineral content, this rosé really needs food. Fresh red currant and raspberry fruitiness are surrounded by tannins and tight acidity. Drink by 2015.",Les Baronnes,88,25.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Rosé,Henri Bourgeois
1983,Portugal,"Ripe and smooth, this is a rich, rounded wine that has a warm character, tasting of sunshine.

1984,Argentina,"Jammy cassis, blackberry and foxy aromas define the nose on this lush, almost ponderous blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Petit Verdot. There's flatness to the palate along with flavors of blackbery, plum and dark, minty oak. A heavy, grabby finish is bold and voluminous.",Terroir Series Corte Malbec-Bonarda-Petit Verdot,88,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Kaiken
1985,Italy,"This is rather subdued but after ample time in the glass it reveals aromas of oak, toast, espresso and chocolate that continue on to the palate along with vanilla notes. It lacks the vintage's hallmark intensity. Drying tannins give an astringent finish.",Coste di Rose,88,90.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Marchesi di Barolo
1986,Italy,"Pretty aromas include violet, crushed berries and a balsamic note. But the palate isn't very expressive, offering up raw Morello cherry and espresso notes alongside racy acidity and astringent tannins. Drink after 2020.",Bricco delle Viole,88,58.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Mario Marengo
1987,US,"Old Wente clones drive the richness of this wine, a mix of lemon, oak and fennel, with a touch of spice on the finish. A waft of buttered popcorn invites intrigue aromatically, developing into creaminess on the body. Bacigalupi has a history of famous Chardonnay, having provided grapes for Chateau Montelena's winning Chardonnay in the 1976 Paris Tasting.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,88,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Peter Paul Wines
1988,Argentina,"There's a mix of herbal aromas and raisin on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. In the mouth, it's edgy and rubbery, with rock-hard tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits, tobacco and citrus peel finish raw and rubbery. This will need a lot of air and also hearty  food to show its better side.",Grand Reserve Winemaker's Selection,88,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Red Blend,Proemio
1989,US,"A penetrating whiff of wintergreen is the first impression of this aromatic young wine. The tightly-wound fruit brings cranberry and tart plum flavors into focus, followed by a lick of dark chocolate running through stiff tannins.",,88,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Roco
1990,France,"This is a firmly wood-aged wine, full of spice and burnt toast flavors. They leave little room for the berry fruits at the moment. It is structured, a statement wine with its heavy bottle, and needing time to round out. Drink from 2016.",Marie de Beauregard,88,,Loire Valley,Chinon,,Cabernet Franc,Saget la Perrière
1991,US,"This is a rich, broad-shouldered Pinot Noir, woodsy and oaky with a firm and fierce grip on the palate. It leans more toward earth and smoke than exuberant fruit.

1993,Portugal,"This is a rich and jammy wine, packed with black fruits as well as dark tannins. Dark chocolate flavors come from the wood aging which also leaves a burnt taste. These both suggest this potentially fine wine needs to age. Drink from 2016.",Veedha,88,12.0,Douro,,,Portuguese Red,Sogevinus
1994,US,"Even with some hours of breathing time, this remains tight and tannic, with compact flavors of black cherry hard candy. A streak of cola is highlighted with brown spices. The wine loses momentum in the finish, which thins out and quickly fades.",La Colina Vineyard,88,60.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Torii Mor
1995,US,"Loaded with scents and flavors of chocolate, mocha and buttered toast, this forward and very pretty wine surrounds a light core of strawberry and cherry fruit.

1997,Spain,"Despite being nine years old, this comes across young and jammy, with foxy aromas of wild berries and animal fur. The palate is blocky, heavily extracted and fully ripe in feel. Flavors of prune and blackberry finish with hard tannins. Drink or hold.",200 Monges Selección Especial Reserva,88,120.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Vínícola Real
1998,Italy,"This Barolo has a somewhat raw quality, delivering sensations of tart red cherry, black pepper, sage, coffee bean and bitter chocolate. The bracing tannins are astringent and overpowering at this stage. Try it after 2020.",Boiolo,88,99.0,Piedmont,Barolo,,Nebbiolo,Camparo
1999,US,"Stewed tomato, graphite and mushrooms in a brown sauce lead the aromas on this single-vineyard offering from downtown Santa Barbara-based winemaker Ryan Carr.

2004,France,"This super-rich wine is dominated by ripe Merlot that is given structure by leaner Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is ripe, full of black plum flavors and dark tannins.

2007,Spain,"Minerally, warm aromas are rustic and savory, with berry power lurking in the backdrop.

2008,US,"The nose on this estate bottling is sparse at first, with pencil shavings and a speck of boysenberry fruit. It opens more once sipped, delivering a pleasant tartness powered by sour cherry flavors and a tiny bit of clove.",Dierberg Vineyard,87,44.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Dierberg
2009,France,"This is steely, crisp and mineral. It is brightly lit by acidity and juicy green fruits, plums and limes. Over all the fruitiness, a tight structure gives a cool aftertaste.",,87,20.0,Loire Valley,Quincy,,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Roux
2010,France,"The softest hint of apricot can be discerned on the nose. The palate reinforces this flavor with more soft stone fruit and just a touch of off-dry sweetness. The result is a very expressive, gently but deeply fruited, slender palate that will sing with spicy Asian dishes or soft cheeses. It offers wonderfully lasting flavor.",Vieilles Vignes,90,22.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Auxerrois,Paul Blanck
2011,US,"Delicate yet well-integrated, this emphasizes flavors high in tongue-tickling acidity. Lemon, lime and orange fruit, along with a touch of leather, runs into a finish hinting at wild cherry, cola and molasses. It's subtle, but convincing.",Attica Vineyard,90,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,,Pinot Noir,Raptor Ridge

2013,Spain,"Aromas of raw oak, cinnamon, bacon and clove outmuscle fruit on this rough, tannic, scraping 2013. Flavors of toast, chocolate and baking spices push blackberry and black-plum fruit towards an oaky, abrasive finish with rocky tannins and accents of chocolate and cinnamon. Holding this for another couple of years may or may not soften this fierce but tasty RDD.",Crianza,90,40.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Arzuaga

2015,US,"This blend of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Malbec and 22% Petit Verdot is rich and layered on the nose with black-cherry, blueberry, dark-chocolate and roasted-beef aromas.

2017,US,"Leather, cedar and tobacco figure most prominently here with an additional 12% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend helping matters.

2018,US,"This wine combines 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Zinfandel and 3% Petit Verdot from the producer's Three Palms Vineyard.

2019,US,"A seductive oak aroma and richly layered fruit flavors make this wine a bit of a show stopper. The fine-grained tannins add a velvety mouthfeel, while the full body adds extra viscosity to extend the aftertaste.",Schatz Family Reserve,90,60.0,California,Lodi,Central Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peltier
2020,Germany,"Stridently purple in hue, this bold, richly berried wine deftly blends the spice and smoke of Lemberger with the plush black fruit and bramble of Merlot and Dornfelder.

2022,Spain,"This is one of the most inky, concentrated, fiercely tannic vintages of Alion to date. Aromas of granite, boysenberry and grilled meat feed into a biting, full-bodied palate that can only benefit from more time. Blackberry, vanilla and chocolate flavors finish with mocha notes and stocky, rugged tannins. This is fierce and unrefined now; drink from 2018 through 2027.",,90,95.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Alion
2023,US,"Smoky, earthy, black pepper aromas make this wine catchy at the first sniff, and then the flavors fill the mouth with similarly spicy, earthy suggestions.

2025,Australia,"This medium-bodied Shiraz is refreshingly medium-bodied and drinkable, with softly dusty tannins on the finish that don't get in the way of present enjoyment.

2026,US,"Intriguing aromas of wilting rose petals, turned earth, wild mint and a lamb-like gamey character entertain the nose on this very special bottling.

2027,Germany,"Schloss Vollrad's standard-label Kabinett has a distinctly sheer, almost ephemeral lightness.

It finishes long with a lingering kiss of sweetness.",Kabinett,90,25.0,Rheingau,,,Riesling,Schloss Vollrads
2028,Australia,"From vines that were 79 years old when the fruit was harvested, this is made in a deliberately lean style to encourage cellaring. Notes of lemon, crushed stone and apple skin are taut and dry, with a dusty, tactile sensation on the finish.

The two elements are integrating well. Drink from 2019.",Grandes Vignes,90,,Burgundy,Marsannay,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Bart
2031,France,"A perfumed village wine, this is made from four different parcels. The wine offers an attractive touch of tannin and spice to go with the forward red fruits. It should develop relatively quickly, and will be ready to drink from 2018.",,90,,Burgundy,Beaune,,Pinot Noir,Domaine des Croix
2032,France,"The nose has the rich fruity tones of apple and plum peel. The palate is wonderfully clean and fresh, with a slight phenolic frame which lends both structure and texture.

2033,US,"Emblematic of the emerging trend of pushing finished alcohol levels down and aromatics up, this puts the flavor emphasis on subtle complexity. It offers a full range of tart red fruits, along with seams of dried leaf and milk chocolate.

2041,US,"Stunningly good for an entry-level Pinot Noir, this new Tavola gets the sort of care generally reserved for reserves. Native yeast fermentation and almost a year in 20% new French oak is where it starts; then a barrel selection is made and it's bottled unfined and unfiltered.

2042,France,"From a small parcel of 19th-century vines planted on the hill of Saint-Mont, this is a finely structured rich wine.

2043,Austria,"Rich and developed dried pear and apricot notes stream from the nose of this wine, signifying its evolution.

2050,US,"This dazzling, dry and restrained wine was matured in new French oak but with such a light touch that it feels more lean than fat in texture.

2717,US,"This wine initially presents itself as lighter in body than it actually is, a tease from the cool-climate aromas of cucumber, dill and cranberry tea.

2732,Italy,"Dark-skinned berry, forest floor, pipe tobacco, new leather and balsamic notes float out of the glass. On the elegantly structured palate, taut, polished tannins and vibrant acidity frame ripe red cherry, exotic spice and aromatic herb flavors. A lingering star anise note announces the close.

2733,France,"Richly endowed, the wine is beautifully concentrated. Still young it has considerable potential with its rich fruits and firm tannins.

2734,France,"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert.

This shows lovely flavors of maturity but has only just got going. The freshness is incisive, the complexity and length immense. This is simply beautiful and leaves you totally refreshed. Savor this slowly. Drink now through 2030.",Osterberg Grand Cru,95,38.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Cave de Ribeauvillé
2736,France,"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts.

It's all intricately woven by time into something wonderful.",Sierra Madre,95,50.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Arcadian
2739,France,"Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment.

2740,France,"A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep.

Drink from 2025.,,95,250.0,Bordeaux,Pomerol,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Trotanoy
2743,France,"There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.",Engelberg Grand Cru,95,45.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Pfister

2745,France,"The heady scent of Damask rose hints unmistakably to Gewürztraminer. The palate follows lusciously, generously and luxuriantly: wonderfully sweet notions of peach, ripe apricot and yellow mirabelle plum are perfumed with a rose petal scent but are also pervaded by a gentle citrus freshness that lifts everything. The length is astonishing and dreamy. This is dangerously delicious.",Grand Cru Pfersigberg Doux,95,90.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Barmès-Buecher
2746,France,"After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean.

3016,US,"Vanilla and caramel show right away on the nose of this bottling, followed by stewed blackberry and black plum sauce, proving quite jammy but layered with burnt sugar aromas.

But there are also richer hints of honey and yellow apple. The palate remains taut, slender and linear but that tangelo spice is boosted by enticing herbal notes of yarrow and a dollop of yeast.

The palate follows with the same aromatic intensity, enriching the peach compote notes even further with lemony barley sugar and fresh caramel, pierced by tangy citrus acidity.

Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated. Drink now–2030.",One,95,95.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,,Red Blend,Heartland

3049,France,"A lovely heady note of citrus peel and moss hovers above the crisp apple notes of the nose. The bone-dry palate is taut, streaked with absolute lemon freshness and very, very pure. This is linear and totally toned, majoring in the tart and invigorating end of the citrus spectrum. All the more excitement for us. Notions of wet stone pop up and remain on the palate. This is refreshing now but will absolutely reward patience. Drink from 2020 through 2035.",Kirchberg de Ribeauvillé Grand Cru,95,100.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Cave de Ribeauvillé

3053,France,"The lifted nose seems like an amalgam of chalk and dried apples along with lemon zest. The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long.
